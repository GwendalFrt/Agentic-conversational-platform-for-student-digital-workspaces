# Agentic Conversational Platform for Student Digital Workspaces


This project was carried out as part of a school project. My goal was to develop a chatbot application based on an **agentic AI system**, dedicated to students and specialized in some of their tasks. This application is small in scale and intended as a prototype for a more powerful tool. A more advanced version could automate student support and improve access to university information.  

The work does not aim to compete with the leading players in the field but rather seeks to **explore and understand the mechanisms currently used in applications based on generative text AI**.

## System Overview

This agentic system is based on three agents:

- **Smart Planner**: a SQL agent able to query student schedules and answer questions about them.  
- **info_UVSQ**: an agent using RAG to assist students with questions about the university.  
- **AssistantTeacher**: an agent based on a RAG system, designed to retrieve context from courses exported to markdown and chunked for easier processing.

## Public Repository Notice

As this repository is public, some files have been excluded to **avoid leaking sensitive information** (e.g., course content for intellectual property reasons). While these data are not included here, the UVSQ information was based on the **university’s public website**.
